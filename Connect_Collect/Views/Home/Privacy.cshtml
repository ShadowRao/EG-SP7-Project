            At Connect&Collect, we take your privacy seriously, so rest easy! Your contact details will only be shared if and when another user is genuinely interested in purchasing the awesome products you’ve listed. Other than that, your personal information stays locked up tighter than a secret recipe—safe with us and not shared with anyone.
            We also encourage you to keep things fun and fair by posting only items in good, usable condition. After all, no one wants a surprise when buying! Remember, respect for each other makes this marketplace work like a charm. 😊

            If you encounter any issues or have concerns about a listing, don’t hesitate to give us a shout by reporting it—we’re here to keep this community awesome!
